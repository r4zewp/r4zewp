### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @r4zewp

I've been studying in Higher School of Economics (Moscow, Russia) for 3,5 years. Originally from Tashkent, Uzbekistan.

My very first Flutter experience was in late 2019 leading to "Labor exchange app for students only" app creation.

From 2020 to late 2021 had been developing some projects with my own team: E-Shop (Flutter web), E-Commerce platform (Flutter web), Quiz app.

Starting from Nov 2021 to Dec 2022, had been working on "Social media app" creation in startup called "Notos" (https://notos.me). Some things went wrong and development was freezed for unknown period

Now (Jan 2023) I'm looking forward to create something special in fast-growing startup or company that needs my help <3
