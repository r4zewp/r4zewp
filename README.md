ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm @r4zewp
I'm alumni of Higher School of Economics on Business-Informatics and currently studying on Masters in HSE.

- My very first Product Management experience was in early 2020, leading to the creation of a "Student Financial Planner" app.

- From the beginning of 2021 to late 2021, I collaborated with my own team on projects like a Personal Finance Tracker, an Investment Analysis Tool, and a Budgeting Assistant.

- Starting from November 2022 up to now, I work on developing innovative financial solutions at a FinTech startup called TalentPay. We're working on payroll platfrom for contractors from all over the world.
